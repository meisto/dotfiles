## About
**WIP** I am still in the process of migrating.  
My dotfiles.


## Instalation
Be careful, running this script may destroy your existing setup. **It does not have all necessary security checks and may alter your files without asking.** If you want to be sure that it will not break your installation, please copy and paste the files you need by hand.  
```bash
/bin/bash build.sh
```
This sets up my vimrc.
